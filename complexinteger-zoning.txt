# Michael Kirsch - Complex Integer Program - Zoning

# A retirement community consists of 5 zones.  Only two of the zones can be
# assigned a fire station, but all five need to be serviced by the two stations.
# Each assigned station zone-fire zone pair has a different response time
# (in minutes) to a fire in that zone. Station responses to the zones to which
# they are assigned are obviously the fastest, and then decline in farther away
# zones.   There are two decision variables, which zones to assign the fire
# stations to, and, subsequently, to which assigned station-zone to assign  each
# of the remaining non-station fire zone. The objective is to minimize the average
# response times.

# One constraint is having only two stations that can be assigned.  Another
# is that two stations cannot be assigned to the same zone. Another is that
# the fire zones that do not have stations assigned to them cannot be assigned
# to other non-station fire zones. They must be assigned to a station-zone.

# Solution:

44 minutes average response time.

Stations are assigned to zone 2 and 5 of Pilgrim Haven.

Fire-zone 1 is then assigned to station-zone 5, and fire-zone 3
and 4 are assigned to station-zone 2.
